        <p>
            We are a charity, that gives families one less thing to worry about, when their sick child
            needs to stay in hospital, by providing a warm, comfortable, free place to stay, and someone
            to talk to, all just minutes away from their child's bedside.

                    as well as practical and emotional support so they can be there for their child.

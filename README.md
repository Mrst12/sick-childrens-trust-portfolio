# Sick Children's Trust Portfolio

## Introduction

In August 2013 My nearly two year old daughter needed open heart surgery at Leeds General Infirmary, to save her life. She was born with Tetrology of Fallots, she underwent her first heart surgery at 8 weeks old where they fitted a temporary shunt.
She then needed a second life saving operation and at this time we lived in Lincolnshire, over 80 miles away from the hospital, we were offered a place to stay at Eckersley house in Leeds, a 2 minute walk to the hospital, this house was run by a charity called the Sick Children's Trust, it allows families of sick children to stay close to the hospital in a 'home from home' environment.
We had never even heard of the Sick Children's trust let alone it's houses, needless to say we spent a great amount of time there, and was overwhelmed by the generosity and support given to us during such a difficult time.
We spent the whole day at my daughters bedside in intensive care, then high dependancy, followed by a main ward, to be able to have somewhere to go at night to have a shower, have a meal, have a comfortable room to relax in and have some downtime in, really helped us cope and be on hand should we be needed.
It was one act of kindness that will never be forgotten from the Sick Children's Trust.
The aim of this website is to raise the profile of the Sick Children's Trust and broaden the scope to show people they are there if they should ever need their help, also most importantly give something back.

## Planning

### Strategy

- The site aims to reach out to the general public, who have children or teenagers that are sick needing hospital care, where the family live too far away to return to the hospital when their child has to remain.
- The site aims to be easy to use, with clear directions as to what each page of the website is intended for.
- The aim of the website is to give the user all the necessary information should they ever need to use the service.

### Scope

#### Requirements of the site

- Easy navigation from one page to the next, and also on the page itself.
- A mixture of images, text, and links so the information is not repetitive.
- Same page layout across the pages for ease of use.


### Structure

- The site will be the same layout throughtout the pages for ease of use.
- Any links will be opened in a new tab so the user can redirect back to the main site, without using the browser buttons.
- The site aims to be intuitive, with no hidden content so the user knows what information is available.

### Surface

- Colours and logo's will be taken from the main Sick Children's Trust website, so the user can see a connection between the two sites.
- Layouts across the pages will be consistent with the header and footer being the same.
- Content aims to be relevant, intuitive and understandable with clear direction on what each page is for.
- The whole site aims to be informative and helpful to those that need the service.
- The site will be linked to the Main Sick Children's Trust website, so if any other information is required, the user will have the capability of obtaining the information easily.

## Introduction

In August 2013 My nearly two year old daughter needed open heart surgery at Leeds General Infirmary, to save her life. She was born with Tetrology of Fallots, she underwent her first heart surgery at 8 weeks old where they fitted a temporary shunt.
She then needed a second life saving operation and at this time we lived in Lincolnshire, over 80 miles away from the hospital, we were offered a place to stay at Eckersley house in Leeds, a 2 minute walk to the hospital, this house was run by a charity called the Sick Children's Trust, it allows families of sick children to stay close to the hospital in a 'home from home' environment.
We had never even heard of the Sick Children's trust let alone it's houses, needless to say we spent a great amount of time there, and was overwhelmed by the generosity and support given to us during such a difficult time.
We spent the whole day at my daughters bedside in intensive care, then high dependancy, followed by a main ward, to be able to have somewhere to go at night to have a shower, have a meal, have a comfortable room to relax in and have some downtime in, really helped us cope and be on hand should we be needed.
It was one act of kindness that will never be forgotten from the Sick Children's Trust.
The aim of this website is to raise the profile of the Sick Children's Trust and broaden the scope to show people they are there if they should ever need their help, also most importantly give something back.
